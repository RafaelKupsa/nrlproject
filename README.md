# nrlproject
Programming project for the seminar Neural Representation Learning, LMU MÃ¼nchen SS21

## Motivation

This project was realized for the seminar "Algorithmische und formale Aspekte II" (Neural representation learning) at the LMU university of Munich in the summer semester 2021.
The goal of the project was to get familiar with working with transformer architectures and in the process comparing two different models (BERT and CANINE) on their performance in next sentence classification in poetry as well as rhyming sentence classification.
